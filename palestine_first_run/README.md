## Features

* Check app is @ first run
* Check custom actions is @ first call

## Getting started

To start, import package

```dart
import 'package:palestine_first_run/palestine_first_run.dart';
```

## Usage

Ensure flutter framework is active

* Add this to the beginning of `main()`

```dart
// Make Sure Framework Is Ready
WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
```

Just as easy as this

```dart
// First time (true), then (false)
final bool isFirstRun = await PalestineFirstRun.isFirstRun();
```

And for the custom calls

```dart
// First time (true), then (false)
final bool isFirstAPICall = await PalestineFirstRun.isFirstCall('call_api');
```
